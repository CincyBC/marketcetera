* New Features *
================
- add strategy view
- fix sessions target/sender seq num not updating
- positions view
- suggestions view
- order suggestions in order ticket
- rename main class from App to Photon (or something) so that it shows up in the process list (jps) as such
- need add help menu
- need about menu with attributions and copyright
- experiment with style of windows to make them more compact?
-- change windows to use popups instead of new stages?
-- main workspace probably needs to be a flow pane instead of vbox
-- investigate Draggable
-- investigate https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16925612/how-to-resize-component-with-mouse-drag-in-javafx
- add cluster view
- add view metrics module (with rpc, etc)
- reports needs add report action
- configurable way to set number of decimals to display for all types
- remove style service as a bad idea
- convert fix session panes to use inner classes
- traderAdmin should have view fix sessions permission
- expand FIX wizard to allow specification of multiple host/port combinations for failover?
-- either that or need to do something that allows freeform settings to be added instead of just the normal ones
- enforce patterns on fix session attributes in fix session wizard
- add new permission for activate/deactivate users and use them in UserView context menu
- create common dialog/confirmation pattern for context menus in PhotonServices and use for all relevant context menu items
- add ActivateUser to AdminClient and use in UserView context menu
- work on blockchains MDA for market data views
- if md client goes offline, mark all views as disabled
- md client comes back online, resubmit md requests
- window onClose not fired on app shutdown so nothing gets saved - can't rely on onClose to save important view info
- probably need to handle DELETE events in market data list view
- add chart to market data detail view

* Bugs *
========
- market data client returns no available capabilities
- broker algos in order ticket
- custom fields in order ticket
- transfer text to order in order ticket
- peg to midpoint in order ticket
- resize main window not stored in window properties?, should be reset on login
- cascade and tile not working yet
- weird always-on-top issue with window system
- order ticket not formatted with last know values
- replace order ticket values not filled out
- menus are not fully recursive: only go to top level
- incorporate session id validator in fix session wizard session identity page
- failed fix session actions return "UNKNOWN" instead of a useful error message
- defining a FIX session w/o a heartbeatint causes all kinds of havoc on client and server
- update fix session adds new session instead of updating old one
- add fix session shows empty session name in the update message
- check permissions for add FIX session
- can't delete user with supervisor permissions
- can't delete user with roles
- need to sort out password hashing/sending/authenticating between client and server
- adminClient requires old password when changing password, but that requires keeping it around, which is a security issue. remove the old password parameter from the call.
- PhotonServices.successStyle needs to match initial style, instead adds a light boundary
- deactive user causes stale row error
- add check to add/update user to see if the username is already in use
- need to add permissions to roles add or update
- changing permissions doesn't work in adding/updating permissions
- add admin views
-- supervisor permissions

*****************
* strategy view *
*****************
- reverify strategy before starting
- ability to pass params when starting a strategy (and for autostarting it, somehow)
-- maybe make params part of the instance in a subtable?
- need a third strategy directory for strategy caching, reload on startup from cache dir to incoming strategy dir (for verification)
- strategy running update events

- cancel big uploads
- run on different cluster members? report strategy status on all cluster members
- special category of events?
- compare meta data on activate or discard?
- run multiple versions of an uploaded stratergy w/o having to upload it again (duplicate from strategy context menu?)
- nonce should not be in the strategy instance - pass it as a parameter to the new strategy instance and it can be stored adjacently
- combine upload progress bar and status, perhaps using a VBox as the cell type
- hash should not be returned to the client as this is a security risk. someone could calculate a hash-collision for a jar and push that one up instead?
- remove hash from FileUploadMetaData
- add type to FileUploadMetaData and remove hardcoded type in StrategyRpcServer
- move verification from StrategyRPCServer to StrategyServiceImpl
- add attribute to strategy instance:
-- auto start
- strategy events should be in db to allow pagination - could be lots and lots
- strategy persistence? that is, can we reload strategies at start? we had something like this before with executing run files at SE start

- merge 1102 to 4.1.x
- update build instructions
- make 4.1.x the main branch

x implement stop strategy
xx stop strategy is fundamentally simple: just stop the context that was started
xx simplify strategy start by directly creating the context, don't use provisioning agent
xx cache the context when a strategy is started. to stop it, just call .stop() on the context
