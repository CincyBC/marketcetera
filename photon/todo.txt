* New Features *
================
- order suggestions in order ticket
- rename main class from App to Photon (or something) so that it shows up in the process list (jps) as such
- need add help menu
- need about menu with attributions and copyright

- convert fix session panes to use inner classes
- fix sessions target/sender seq num not updating
- traderAdmin should have view fix sessions permission
- expand FIX wizard to allow specification of multiple host/port combinations for failover?
-- either that or need to do something that allows freeform settings to be added instead of just the normal ones
- enforce patterns on fix session attributes in fix session wizard

* Bugs *
========
- broker algos in order ticket
- custom fields in order ticket
- transfer text to order in order ticket
- peg to midpoint in order ticket
- stop all running threads when main workspace closes (might be an issue with underlying grpc and netty)
- resize main window not stored in window properties?, should be reset on login
- cascade and tile not working yet
- weird always-on-top issue with window system
- order ticket not formatted with last know values
- replace order ticket values not filled out
- menus are not fully recursive: only go to top level
- incorporate session id validator in fix session wizard session identity page
- failed fix session actions return "UNKNOWN" instead of a useful error message
- defining a FIX session w/o a heartbeatint causes all kinds of havoc on client and server
- update fix session adds new session instead of updating old one
- add fix session shows empty session name in the update message
- check permissions for add FIX session
- can't delete user with supervisor permissions
- can't delete user with roles
- need to sort out password hashing/sending/authenticating between client and server
- adminClient requires old password when changing password, but that requires keeping it around, which is a security issue. remove the old password parameter from the call.
- PhotonServices.successStyle needs to match initial style, instead adds a light boundary
- deactive user causes stale row error
- add check to add/update user to see if the username is already in use
- need to add permissions to roles add or update
- changing permissions doesn't work in adding/updating permissions
- moving multiple permissions in the role add/update doesn't seem to work
- add admin views
-- supervisor permissions

x server status toolbar, needs to do something
x do the admin views have permissions set for them? - no permissions exist for ViewUsers, ViewRoles, ViewPermissions - need to be added to UserViewFactory
x go back to old icons
